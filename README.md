### Hi there 🙋‍♂️
I am Dr. Pierre Olivier, a data analyst/data scientist with a passion for the sea and environment.

### 💧 About Me in 30 Secs 💧
- I have a Ph.D. in biological oceanography since April 2022 🧑‍🔬
- I apply statistics and machine learning to (environmental) data
- I have a rare skill: I combine networks, graphs, and time series (see my [publications](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=QaG46p0AAAAJ&hl=en))
- I regularly expand my skill set: currently learning "Tableau" & Mexican Cumbia (🕺💃)
- I love teaching and communicating science through blogs and social media @[SHINE.Science](https://www.instagram.com/shine.science/) and @[OceanFact](https://www.instagram.com/oceanfact/)
